							<p class="description"> One of the things about the marching percussion world is

								with people you've worked with. Thus, when a friend of mine asked if I would help out 
								at his program, I decided to show up for a day or two. I liked the kids and the atmosphere so much,

							<p>* More rather, a note on skills. It is typical for every resume to have a "skills" section
								where one puts those things that he/she finds makes them a good employee, candidate, 
								<em> et cetera. </em></p>
							<p class="center-me-please"> I hate these sections.</p> 
							<p>I find that they tend to be bland, uninventive and, frankly, fail to capture qualities that 
								I would look for in somebody I would like to work with. </p>
							<p>Don't get me wrong, I too would want to look for smart, talented people, but being good 
							at something (hell, even being <em>great</em> at something) does not impress me.</p>
							<p>There are countless people who are good at things. But the people who are good at things, 
							pursue knowledge, and seek to understand diversity, these are the people I want to be with.</p>
							<p class="center-me-please">And so, I'll say this about myself...</p>
							<p>Not that I'm smart or a hard-worker; on the contrary, I think there are smarter people and harder workers.</p>
							<p class="center-me-please">Rather, that I have 3 choice skills:
								<ol>
									<li>I am willing and want to learn</li>
									<li>I try to be as unassuming as possible, for assuming leads blindness, and blindness is ignorance</li>
									<li>Above all, and at the end of the day, I love people and want to work with cools ones</li>
