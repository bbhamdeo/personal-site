						<p class="content-title">My name is Benjamin Bhamdeo. My friends call me Ben.</p>
					</div>
					<p>I am a proud graduate of 
						<a class="rutgers-link" href="http://www.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University</a> 
						and an even prouder pupil of the 
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics">Classics.</a></p>
					
					<p>As a result, I have been a student of philosophy, history, historiography, politics, foreign affairs,  
						comedy, satire & drama, philology, linguistics, mythology, religion, sociology, literature, art history, 
						and archaeology, to name a few overlapping disiplines. </p>

					<p>I also speak Ancient Greek, which, as you might imagine, 
						is a fun line to drop at parties every once in a while.</p>

					<p>Outside of classics, I focused on legal studies, part time, particually American Constitutional Law and 
						Campaign Finance Law.</p>	

					<p>I am a percussionist and a large part of my life has been devoted
						to music, espcially the 
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_percussion">marching arts</a>.</p> 

					<p>I also dabble in the world of computer science and programming 
						and although I don’t consider myself to be a “real” developer, 
						I love and respect the tech world and community and do frequent 
						<a class="hacker-news" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.</p>

					<div class="intro-container">
						<p class="introduction center-me-please">But aside from all that boring stuff…</p>
					</div>

					<p>I like fantasy/sci fi, a well-written script, World Culture, J.R.R. Tolkien, Starcraft II 
						& E-Sports, 
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_games_as_an_art_form">Quality Video Games</a>, 
						Team Fortress 2, Exercise & Meditation, Coffee & Tea, 
						
						<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxKtZmQgxrI">these reviews</a> (warning: harsh language!), 

						cute animals, and so much more that they have 
						they’re 
						
						<a href="/stuff-i-like">own page</a>!

						Aren’t they lucky? </p>

					<p>Take a look around! If you like what you see and want to get in touch, good news: 
						
						<a href="/get-in-touch">there's a page for that</a>, too!</p>

					<p class="center-me-please"> :D </p>
